# Russian Roulette Game

I have been working my way through the [Rust "Guessing Game" tutorial][0] and I 
thought I'd mix it up a little bit and code up a short game of my own. I was
looking for something simple that I could bang out without jumping too far ahead
in the book.

Mostly this is just a sample project so that I could work on getting a Rust 
program to build in all of the target environments.
